# Codex Vitae

_Based on the [original from Buster Benson][1] (further references below), this is my public version of the Codex Vitae. That means this is one that I am sharing as a work in progress -- much of that work taking place through discussion on [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me) as part of the VIP Program (highly recommended)._

#### Instructions

- *If you’re Steve:*
     1. Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
     2. As often as you can, re-read your beliefs, principles, opinions: if they don't match with life, do they need revision, or does life itself need some adjustment?
- *If you’re not Steve:*
     1. Feel free to read and take anything you like from this. If it seems like something you'd like to do, use the references here and consider creating your own Codex Vitae.
     2. If you're part of the Coach.me VIP Program, feel free to offer any feedback that comes to mind.


## Beliefs

### Meta-beliefs
_Beliefs about beliefs._

"Belief Systems = BS. The BS we tell ourselves is the stuff that keeps us trapped." -- Stephan Spencer on [The Productivityist Podcast, 19 July 16](https://productivityist.com/podcast-stephan-spencer/)

**Beliefs constrain us more than they define us.**

## Selfcare

### Productivity

#### Beliefs

"There is no greater productivity tip than realising what you absolutely don't need to be doing." -- Merlin Mann B2W Ep 280

---

[YAGNI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it):

"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."

"do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW) -- meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous refactoring, continuous automated unit testing, and continuous integration. Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework. YAGNI's dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of XP. (TK rework this -- quoted for now, but needs to be refined for more general appliation than XP.)

---

Beware (but don't necessarily avoid) [yak shaving](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving):

It is either:

"Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem."

_or_

"A less useful activity done consciously or unconsciously to procrastinate about a larger but more useful task."

If it happens, make sure it is the first of these.

#### Pre-Decisions

- Set (and review) priorities every day.  
- Limit the number of possible outcomes (use the Agile Results methodology).  
- Timebox or schedule whenever there seems to be too much to do in a single day. If it doesn't fit in the time available, then review the day's priorities.

#### Aspirations

Productivity, checking off tasks, is not the aim or the goal. Simplicity, reduced cognitive load, reduced burden, these are the goals.

Work towards doing less, not doing everything on the list. This means knowing just what is needed, and doing just enough so that some things (which at first seemed important) can be put aside for ever.

## Glossary

_Ideas or terms that may need some explaining._

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore][5]. The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.
