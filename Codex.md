# Codex Vitae

_Based on the [original from Buster Benson][1] (further references below), this is my public version of the Codex Vitae. That means this is one that I am sharing as a work in progress -- much of that work taking place through discussion on [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me) as part of the VIP Program (highly recommended)._

#### Instructions

- *If you’re Steve:*
     1. Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
     2. As often as you can, re-read your beliefs, principles, opinions: if they don't match with life, do they need revision, or does life itself need some adjustment?
- *If you’re not Steve:*
     1. Feel free to read and take anything you like from this. If it seems like something you'd like to do, use the references here and consider creating your own Codex Vitae.
     2. If you're part of the Coach.me VIP Program, feel free to offer any feedback that comes to mind.

## Glossary

_Ideas or terms that may need some explaining._

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore][5]. The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.
