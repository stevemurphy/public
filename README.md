# About

This is my public version of the Codex Vitae. Other things about me or by me may also end up here.

The Codex Vitae is based on the [original from Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public) (further references below). My version here is one that I am sharing as a work in progress -- much of that work taking place through discussion on [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me) as part of the VIP Program (highly recommended).

As such, this will be fine-tuned, tweaked, tooled, improved or even discarded, as time and the universe dictate (or at least, as they suggest -- I will not be dictated to).

I, too, am a work in progress. What appears in this Codex Vitae may or may not reflect all that I am or will be. Sharing here helps me work on some things, perhaps in a way that assists others to do something similar. However, while this may help me record what I have learned about myself and life, your life lessons will almost certainly lead you elsewhere. I have no illusions about the "truth" or universality of anything here. It is public, but it is really just for me.

## START HERE: [Codex](Codex.md)

There is nowhere else for now.
